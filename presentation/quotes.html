        <li>“We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “abstraction”; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the <b class="stand-out">purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.</b>” (Edsger W. Dijkstra, The Humble Programmer, ACM Turing Lecture 1972)</li>
        <li>“Remember that every science is based upon an abstraction. An abstraction is taking a point of view or looking at things under a certain aspect or from a particular angle. All sciences are differentiated by their abstraction.” (Fulton J. Sheen, Life Is Worth Living)</li>
        <li>“Abstraction is itself an abstract word and has no single meaning … Every word in our language is abstract, because it represents something else.” (Eric Maisel)</li>
        <li>“Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.” (Benjamin C. Pierce, Types and Programming Languages , 2002)</li>
        <li>“Resistance to abstraction a bit like restricting your speech exclusively to one syllable words that a 2 yr old understands. It's superficially "simpler", until you try to talk about anything interesting w/ precision.” (Paul Chiusano, 2014)</li>
        <li>“There is no way to guarantee in advance what pure mathematics will later find application. We can only let the process of curiosity and abstraction take place, let mathematicians obsessively take results to their logical extremes, leaving relevance far behind, and wait to see which topics turn out to be extremely useful. If not, when the challenges of the future arrive, we won’t have the right piece of seemingly pointless mathematics to hand.” (Peter Rowlett, "The unplanned impact of mathematics", Nature 475, 2011)</li>
